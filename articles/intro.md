What is a Computer?
===================



Before we answer what is an OS, we should know why does a computer exist in the first place? Then we can see where does OS come into the picture.

To better answer this, lets take a calculator. When you use a calculator, do you ask why do I need a calculator? No, because its implicit. We use calculator to calculate large numbers like months of financial records, expenses, to calculate budget, etc. You don’t need calculator to add 2+2 but you do need one to calculate 5736589+384700. Because we humans are slow at many tasks which are repetitive and error prone by nature.

That’s why you need a calculator (or a computer) to perform calculations faster, efficient, and save time. Same goes for computer.

**So why does a computer exist again?** — to make our work faster, easier, save time, and reduce error.

**and why does the OS exist inside a computer?** — _to help or aid computers_ in carrying out work faster, safer, save time, be efficient, yada yada.

**What more to a computer?**

When you picture a computer, you probably think of:

1.  A monitor (which is an interface to interact with computer for users)
2.  CPU cabinet which contains storage device, RAM, CPU or processor, fancy lights these days, fans, power unit, wires and some ports. (The part that actually makes a computer, computer)
3.  Keyboard, Mouse, printer, webcam (these are known as I/O devices, if you’re a nerd, say Peripherals)
4.  You should also picture a human using that computer

This picture is simple. All of the above components easily fit on a table and a chair.

But that is not how computers were in its infancy. There were mainframe computers[1]. So huge and bulky, they occupied entire rooms and floors. Computing was expensive too. Only big businesses used these on dollars per hour basis.

Imagine you owned a warehouse which has mainframe computers all over. Companies like coca-cola, ibm, pepsi, xerox are coming to your doorstep with their financial data, asking you to calculate their annual cash flow statement. Your job is to feed those data in the mainframe to get desired result for your clients.

Computers then, were good at calculating too. But _what_ to calculate and _when_ to calculate still required human input. So, there were human programmers and operators (this operator role was then abstracted to operating system.)

The Programmer will write programs to solve certain business problems.

The Operator will run those programs as per clients’ data and requirements.

_[1] Mainframe computers are still used today. Just not in the way it were. You have heard of data centres and web servers. Google, Microsoft, AWS, all have their own data centres across the globe. That is also considered as mainframe computers, only they have all the modern components which make them more autonomous than they ever used to be. Modern mainframes still require some human input for timely maintenance, upgrades, and basically managing the data centre._
