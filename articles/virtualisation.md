Virtualisation?
===============

WTH is virtual _anything_?

Virtualisation loosely means creating illusion of something real.

Simulation.

Does that mean it’s fake? Well, it’s like cash in your wallet. Is that cash fake?

You see the paper currency (we now have digital currency too.) you carry has no value. The only real money is goods and gold. But long ago society agreed to the fiction that paper money can be used to make transactions.

So, the money in your bank account is virtual money which enables you to buy real stuff.

**Virtual** money, not real, not fake. Virtual.

You can stop here and move to next article. But if you are restless like me, stay.

I want to tell you about form, shape, and functions to better paint the picture of virtualisation.

**Form and function.**

A cup is of a certain shape. It has a certain form. That form enables us to pour liquid, hold the cup, and drink from it.

How does that form come to be in reality? — Before form there is a thing that gives shape to a form.

Formless clay, gives form to a cup, which has now a function.

> Form with function is something real.
> 
> Function without form or shape is virtual.
> 
> Function with simulated form is virtual.

What OS does when it virtualises is, it takes the real CPU and RAM and virtualises it. It creates many simulations/virtual copies of the existing resources. Simulated CPUs and simulated main memory. And each application is assigned its very own virtual environment.
