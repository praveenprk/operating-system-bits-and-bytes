**What is an abstraction?**

An Abstract is anything that is an idea but has no physical form. Abstraction summarises many things into less words. Like the Contents page of a book, it points to every chapter contents and it gives you an *idea* of what information the book contains.

Even the screw and bolt that you see doesn't occur naturally. It is an idea. To fasten materials together. Here bolt and screw 🔩 are made of steel.

First: screw and bolt are abstract ideas.

Second: Some metal is used to bring that abstract into existence. Or you can think, something is used to **bring an abstract idea to a** **form** which has **certain function**.

An Apple 🍎 is an abstract. Apples existed before Eve and Adam took bites. But nobody called it apple. Before it had a name, before time had a name, that red something hanging from a tree, or anything, was just an idea waiting to be eaten, seen, felt, experienced, and named.

**Abstraction everywhere**

In computing, everything is an abstraction and abstraction is inside everything. In fact, in this universe everything is an abstraction. The alphabets, language, colours, stars, numbers. If something is not an abstraction, it is made up of abstractions, which makes that something another abstraction. We never look close enough to know it is one. We are so surrounded by abstractions, we take it for granted.

The numbers 1,2,3. They don't occur naturally. You have never seen 1 or 1000. You have seen 1 or 1000 apples. But the numbers alone, Nope.

To give you another perspective. I want to show you the picture below.

That is a Tally mark. You must have used it in statistics class in school. What does it represent? 

It represents the number 5. That is how cavemen, used to count.

|, ||, |||, ||||.

That is a kind of abstraction. Before modern numbers existed. Roman numbers: I, II, III, IV are another kind of abstraction used to represent numbers.

Now you get the idea of how ancient the idea of abstraction is and how vastly useful it is for us to understand the world around us.

**What has OS to do with abstraction?**

If abstractions has enabled us humans to land on moon. Then, it must do for OS what we want it to do. To run many programs concurrently, to virtualise.

OS provides many such abstractions to work with. One of them is Process.

Next, we cover What is Process?
